This hooks are for firebase framework. They basically about firebase/firestore and firebase/auth services.
I took average of that codes from Net Ninja and modified them for best use cases. They work very well with 
present version. I explained clearly how they would use. 

When you want to use that hooks in your react project, create a react boilerplate, create a firebase project
and app from firebase console, open firebase auth and firestore services on console and write "npm install 
firebase" to the terminal and press enter for download. Be sure when you done that you were installed firebase
version 9 for working all things exactly as i explained.
