This api builded with capabilities of Next.js 12 and Node.js. It's able to make
4 kind of request: GET, POST, PUT and DELETE. I wrote the whole logic of PUT and
DELETE requests. I gave sample functions and instructions and practiced how you
could use them without problem. All requests works as expected.

for accessing main api: "/api/users". GET and POST actions avaible.

for accessing Individual api: "/api/users/:username/". Example: "/api/users/user2/". GET, PUT and DELETE actions avaible.
