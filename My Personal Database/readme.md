This website is my personal website, i simply keep my personal datas on there.

The url is: https://necdetin-api-deposu.vercel.app.

I created this website for both show another sample project in my portfolio and hold/store
my personal infos in a website.

I build this website with next.js. I take membership, encrypt the passwords, log the members in and out, 
allow to change password, take feedbacks and view them in one of my protected pages.

In this website, there is 5 api which i created. One of them is users api which holds the infos of
registered users. Another one is feedback api which i took feedbacks and store on a protected route.
Another one is the quotes api which includes quotes from famous persons in history, and it's public. 
Except that all other api's are private.
